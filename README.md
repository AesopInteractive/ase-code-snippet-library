ASE Code Snippet Library
========================

This is a community-maintained repository of code snippets that help modify the default behavior of [Aesop Story Engine](https://aesopstoryengine.com).

Snippets are organized into categories (folders) and each snippet is placed in its own file with a name that describes what it does.

Thank you to the [EDD team](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/library) and the [CMB2 team](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2-Snippet-Library) for the inspiration for this library.
